# Nancy for GitHub Actions

Run [Sonatype Nancy](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy) as part of your GitHub Actions workflow.

## Inputs

### `goListFile`

**Default** : `go.list`. 

The path to a file containing the output of the `go list` command.
The `go.list` file can be created with a command like: `go list -json -m all > go.list`

### `nancyCommand`

**Default** : `sleuth` 

You can customize this input with other commands and flags recognized by `nancy`. 
 
For example: `sleuth --loud`

## Example Usage

The example below only requires `go` be installed in order to generate the `go.list` file. 
You could instead have some other part of the CI build generate that file for use by `nancy`.
```
name: Go Nancy

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out code into the Go module directory
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Go 1.x in order to write go.list file
      uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        go-version: ^1.13
    - name: WriteGoList
      run: go list -json -m all > go.list

    - name: Nancy
      uses: sonatype-nexus-community/nancy-github-action@master
```

## Development

There are probably better ways, but I found it useful to leverage the [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) project while developing
this github action. This project allows you to push a branch to the github action repo, and use a commit hash to test the behavior
of that branch. For example, a test project that uses the `nancy-github-action` could have the following `.github/workflows/go.yml` file. 
Notice the commit hash `950a8965cd37d8e14aaa6aebd6c0d71b4da71fa3` used below in the `Scan` step to run the 
development branch. 

```
name: Go

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:

  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Set up Go 1.x
      uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        go-version: ^1.13
      id: go

    - name: Check out code into the Go module directory
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: WriteGoList
      run: go list -json -m all > go.list

    - name: Scan
      uses: sonatype-nexus-community/nancy-github-action@950a8965cd37d8e14aaa6aebd6c0d71b4da71fa3
      with:
        nancyCommand: sleuth --loud
```
 
  * Gotchya - As of go v1.15, there is an issue using `act` related to how docker handles http `indentity`
  connections. Due to this issue, I had to run `act` in a Linux Virtual Machine when running go 1.15. The error 
  you see running `act` resulting from this issue looks similar to this:
    ```
    $ act 
    [Go/Build] üöÄ  Start image=node:12.6-buster-slim
    [Go/Build]   üê≥  docker run image=node:12.6-buster-slim entrypoint=["/usr/bin/tail" "-f" "/dev/null"] cmd=[]
    [Go/Build]   üê≥  docker cp src=/Users/bhamail/sonatype/community/go/gh-action-test/. dst=/github/workspace
    Error: error during connect: Post "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/exec/9f2eb3f2ea59b7e41c32efe56a90c2919fe4b459b3f1e763dd02686f797839da/start": net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: unsupported transfer encoding: "identity"
    ```

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `Nancy for GitHub Actions` support in regard to this project
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using Nancy for GitHub Actions, we are glad to have you here!
